## Installation

For libraries and other, I have created a requirements.txt from where you can import all the packages required. In the end, I have exported .exe file for the use of laymans and daily operation people. Basically, for those who are not much into python programming and has basic to no idea on how to use it.


```bash
# Example installation commands
pip install -r requirements.txt
